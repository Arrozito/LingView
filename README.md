How to set up ETST on your own machine:
 - install XAMPP (or MAMP) (if it asks for firewall permissions to private or public networks, no need to give them)
 - extract elan_text_sync_tool.zip to xampp/httools/ETST (xampp/httools should already exist after installing xampp); on Mac, this should be placed in MAMP/htdocs
 - run XAMPP's Apache server
 - in a browser URL bar, type localhost/ETST and hit enter
 - click on the .php file
 - you should see the sample video with glosses/transcript
